He was also an experienced guitarist, banjo player, and violinist. Drawing from his orchestral roots, he transformed the tunes of standards like \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" and \"Inky Pinky Parlez Vous\" into classic baila songs.\nThere has always been some controversy over his name \"Wally\". It is very customary in Sri Lanka, even to day, for children to have nicknames. Although he was baptized OGUSTUS MARTHENEUS after his grandfather Wilhelmus Martheneus, in the family, amongst close relatives, and even amongst his old neighbours, Ogustus was only known as either \"Olie, or Olinton\". Young Ogustus was not very comfortable with his name and mostly went by his initials O.M. Bastiansz rather than Ogustus or Martheneus. After embarking on his musical adventure he aptly adapted his nickname \"Olie\" to be \"Wally\", his well known stage name and, for all official purposes presented himself as Olinton Mervyn Bastianz maintaining his original initials O.M.\nHis songs dealt with everyday life and simple people. One of his hits ('Nurse Nona') was an ode to a nurse in a hospital and another covered the trial of jilted lover Eric Bacho. He sang several songs in English. Other songs written by him, but later ascribed to other popular artistes include Hai Hooi Babi Achchige, Yaman Bando Vesak Balanna, Ratak Watinawa, Le Kiri Karala, Irene Josephine, Kussi Amma Sera, Muhudey Yamu Masun Genenna, Weeriyen Soya, Nondi Simaiyya, Wada Kaha Sudiya, and many others. The song 'Babi Achchige bicycle' was an actual event that happened to Babi Achchi near Prince of Wales' College, Moratuwa.Family\n \nIt is almost an unknown fact that the nurse in his all-time favourite song \"Nurse Nona\" was none other than his own late sister, Felicia Florence Jayasekera (n\u00e9e Bastianz, died 1996) who worked as a nurse in the early 1940s. Florence gave up her job as a nurse in 1944 after her first child was born. In 1969 Florence and her family moved to the ancestral home of the Bastiansz family in Paiyadigama, a small village about 2\u00a0km north of the coast between Galle and Gintota, to take care of their ailing father Hinton Wilmot Bastiansz.\n \nThe old Bastiansz residence in Piyadigama, where Wally Bastiansz and all his eight siblings were born, is now occupied by one of Florence's sons.\n \nWally Bastiansz is closely related to Sri Lankan popular artist Judy de Silva. Wally happens to be Judy's maternal grandfather Edgar de Silva's first cousin. Wally's Father Hinton and Edgar's mother Winifred were brother and sister.\n "}, {"name": "Gunadasa Kapuge", "info": "Sri Lankan musician", "Intro": "Sri Lankan musician", "Was": "Singer", "From": "Sri Lanka", "Type": "Music", "Gender": "male", "Birth": "7 August 1945, Sri Lanka", "Death": "3 April 2003\n(aged 57 years)", "Star sign": "Leo", "description": "Ellamulla Kapuge Gunadasa\n (Sinhala:\u0d91\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd\u0db8\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd \u0d9a\u0db4\u0dd4\u0d9c\u0dda \u0d9c\u0dd4\u0dab\u0daf\u0dcf\u0dc3 , August 7, 1945 - April 3, 2003), better known by his stage name \nGunadasa Kapuge\n, was a Sri Lankan musician.

Her singing ability was noticed by a music professor from Converse College while he was visiting Sri Lanka. She is the first woman from Sri Lanka to attend the Juilliard School, one of the world's leading music schools. She currently lives in New York City, and her career in opera has received international attention.Education\n \nGoonetilleke began learning to sing in Sri Lanka at the age of 12 under the training of Christine Perera. She began attending Converse College in South Carolina in 2001 and graduated in 2005 with Bachelor of Music degree in Vocal Performance and a minor in biology.\n \nRepresenting South Carolina, she entered the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions and won. Impressed by Goonetilleke's performance, the judges, who happened to be from the Juilliard School, asked her whether she had considered attending graduate school. Consequently, she decided to apply for admission to Juilliard, and in 2005, she was the first Sri Lankan woman to be admitted to the Juilliard School and was provided a full tuition scholarship. Her living expenses were covered by President's Fund of Sri Lanka. She graduated from Juilliard with a Master of Music in Voice and Opera.\n Career\n \nIn 1998, Goonetilleke made her singing debut with the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka (SOSL), after winning the SOSL concerto vocal competition in 1998. In 2010, she became a member of New York City Opera, and has since performed in numerous operas such as \nIl trittico\n, \nDialogues of the Carmelites\n, \nLa boh\u00e8me\n, \nDie Zauberfl\u00f6te\n, \nIphig\u00e9nie en Aulide\n, and \nAriodante\n. She has also performed in concerts in the United States, Europe, India, and South Korea. Her 2011 concert tour in India was considered \"timely\" by the Sri Lankan High Commission in India since it helped foster a cultural dialogue between the two countries.\n Personal life\n \nGoonetilleke grew up in Ratmalana, Sri Lanka, near the capital Colombo. She first became interested in opera when she was thirteen when she heard soprano Kiri Te Kanawa sing. However, she did not think at that time that opera was a career option. A music professor from Converse College, Douglas Weeks, was visiting Sri Lanka and heard her sing; he subsequently arranged for her admission to the college. She had planned to study medical science in Sri Lanka, but to her surprise, when her father found out about the offer for her to attend Converse College, he thought it was a good idea.\n \nHer younger sister Eranga also attended Converse College and afterward obtained her master's degree in Opera and Musical Theater from Southern Illinois University; she is currently a faculty member at Converse College's Lawson Academy of the Arts.

He was the first Sri Lankan musician to hold a live one-man concert; His concert known as \"SA\" was first performed in 1973, and was an instant success. Rathnayake credits his success to his \"fitting blend of Western music with Ragadari classical music.\" His songs deal with diverse themes that vary from love, to patriotism and Buddhism.\nMatara Achchi is the first film he composed music for and its Sandakada Pahana song sung by Sunil Edirisinghe is still very popular among Sinhala music fans.

His father, Rathnayake Veda Mahaththaya, was an apothecary and sang \"noorthi gee,\" a type of Sinhala folk songs. Victor got his first instrument at the age of nine when his father presented him a harmonium for his birthday. He studied singing and various instruments under musician Cyril Perera at the M.G.P. Institute in Mulgampola in his teens. In 1963, he began attending the State Music College, now known as the Institute of Aesthetic Studies. He wrote his first song, an ode to Lord Buddha, in 1964; it received play on radio stations run by the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation.\n \nIn 1966, Rathnayke joined the Ministry of Education as a music instructor, and was assigned to a post at Eththalapitiya Maha Vidyalaya in Bandarawela. He would later look back to his days as a teacher in his song \"Sihil Sulang Ralle,\" which described the beauty of his surroundings that he noted as he travelled on the train to the school. The lyrics were penned by Sena Weerasekera on Rathnayake's recollections.\n \nSa\n \nBy 1973, Rathnayake was a trained musician and noted that there were no one man concerts. The closest was \"Shravanaradhana\" a joint concert by Amaradeva and Nanda Malini. On the urging of his friends Premakirthi de Alwis, Sunil Ariyaratne, K.D.K Dharmawardena, R.R. Samarakoon, Chintana Jayasena and Bandara K. Wijetunga, Victor decided to attempt such an event. The first Sa concert was held on July 20, 1973, at the Lumbini Theatre, Havelock Town. It is widely considered a turning point in Sri Lankan music.\n \n \n \n \n Ratnayake performing in his \"Sa\" concert\n \n \n \nThe name \"Sa\" came from the root or tonic note sa in the Indian music scale and was suggested by Chintana Jayasena. Jayasena pointed to the fact that no Sri Lankan drama, film or work of art bore a name of just one syllable at the time and believed that it would bring luck.\n \n\"Sa\" was highly popular, and Rathnayke's gained many fans following its inception. One female fan wrote \"Do you know that I treasure 49 hairs of yours?\" in a fan letter, expressing how many times she has seen Rathnayake's show. Critics described the show as \"exquisite insanity\" and a \"melodic lunacy\" because of the fervor shown by Rathnayke's fans, who would sometimes attack auditoriums where he was playing when they couldn't get in.\n \nRathnayake's style was influenced by musicians like Sunil Shantha, Ananda Samarakone and C. T. Fernando who he considered \"pioneers in the music field\" for their use of \"classical Ragadari and Hindustani music\" as their starting point.\n \nRecent Events\n \nRathnayake continues to be a popular musician in the 2000s; After 39 years of success in Sri Lanka and in many other countries, Victor finally ended the concert on July 20, 2012 at the Lumbini theater where it started with the 1450th concert.

Primarily using traditional instruments like sitars, tablas and harmoniums, Amaradeva incorporates Sinhala folk music with Indian ragas in his work. Many consider Pandit Amaradeva\u2019s contribution to the development of Sinhala music as unmatched, hence without argue cited as the \nMaestro of Sri Lanka Music (si. \u0dc4\u0dd9\u0dc5\u0dba\u0dda \u0db8\u0dc4\u0dcf \u0d9c\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dca\u0daf\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dba\u0dcf)\n.In the mid-1950s, Amaradeva in his Janagayana project consulted experts of the Kandyan dance tradition like Pani Bharata, Kiriganita, Gunamala, Ukkuva and Suramba in his path to understand what constituted Sinhala folk music. Noting that it mostly revolved around a single melody, he decided to add verses that would lead up to the central melody which would now be a chorus thus forming two parts (unseen earlier in traditional Sri Lankan music) removing restrictions that had existed earlier. In doing so, Amaradeva created a uniquely Sinhalese music style that stayed true to folk tradition while incorporating outside influences. His work was vital in the creation of the sarala gee genre practised subsequently by artists like Sanath Nandasiri,Victor Ratnayake,T.M. Jayaratne and Sunil Edirisinghe.Pandit Amaradeva had been the recipient of numerous awards including the Philippine Ramon Magsaysay Award (2001), Indian Padma Sri Award (2002) and Sri Lankan \"President's Award of Kala Keerthi\" (1986) and Deshamanya Award (1998). In 2003 the French government awarded him the prestigious honour; Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Notably he still remains the most popular artist as confirmed by Nielsen Media Research findings He has also represented Sri Lanka in many forums including the UNESCO 1967 Manila Symposium. The University of Kelaniya conferred on him the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Fine Arts) Honoris Causa in 1991 and the University of Ruhuna and University of Peradeniya conferred on him the Degree of Doctor of Letters, Honoris Causa in 1993 and 1998In 1972, Pandit Amaradeva composed the music for the Maldivian National Anthem (Gaumii salaam) at the request of Maldivian Government.Early life and educationAmaradeva was born the youngest of seven children to a carpenter, Wannakuwatta Waduge Don Ginoris Perera, and Balapuwaduge Maggie Weslina Mendis at Janapriya Mawatha in Koralawella, Moratuwa. Perera was a Buddhist while Mendis was a Methodist bringing both Christian and Buddhist values and music traditions to the family.Amardeva was introduced to music at a young age by his father who crafted and repaired violins at Moratumulla Wadu Kaarmika Vidyalaya (Carpentry School). Amaradeva would often strum the violin while his mother sang hymns. Another family influence was Amaradeva's elder brother who taught Indian classical music to him. Amaradeva was presented with his own instrument on his seventh birthday which was a Japanese made tin violin by his father.Amaradeva obtained his early education under Ven. Malalankara Nayaka Tero of the Koralawella temple. With the development of his musical talent, Amaradeva was asked to recite poems and prayers at the temple; he was subsequently picked to lead the village choir.He was first entered into Sri Saddharmodaya Buddhist mixed School in Koralawella. The principal of that school, Mr. Ku. Jo. Fernando was an active member of Hela Hawula and had a close connection with Kumaratunga Munidasa. He knew about Amaradeva\u2019s talent and introduced him to Kumaratunga. Amaradeva was lucky to be appreciated by Kumaratunga for his singing talent. Since he had a chance to accompany all these scholars during his childhood, he had an interest in national identity and language. When he was studying in grade five at Koralawella School, a music teacher called Mr. W. J. Fernando was transferred to his school from Kalutara. Hence, W.J. Fernando was the first school music teacher of Amaradeva. He realized Amaradeva\u2019s talent and directed him on singing and playing. Under his guidance, Amaradeva won all the school singing competitions. Even the teacher let him conduct the classroom when he was not there.While attending the school, he won a poetry contest held at the Moratuwa Vidyalaya. Amaradeva also led the school choir to a triumphant showing at a contest held by the Colombo Arts Society. His poetry win prompted school teachers to get him a showcase to recite poetry on Radio Ceylon. In 1945 Amaradeva won a gold medal at a music and violin contest held by Jana Kala Mandalaya Amaradeva\u2019s fame that was limited only to the Koralawella, started spreading over other areas. Because of his increasing popularity, several schools offered him scholarships.Amaradeva entered Sri Sumangala College, Panadura after completing his primary education with a scholarship for English. At the school, he formed a friendship with the music teacher and principal Danister Thomas Fernando, who was the elder brother of Amaradeva's first music teacher W. J. Fernando. D. T. Fernando who was living in Kalutara helped Amaradeva get into Kalutara Vidyalaya and subsequently to Siddharta Vidyalaya Balapitiya.Young Amaradewa met Sunil Santha, a prominent artist at the time at one of Sunil Santha's concerts. Since he showed interest Sunil Santha invited Amaradewa to audition at Chitrasena studios. There he played in front of Sunil Santha, Chitrasena and A. J. Ranasinghe and impressed them. This meeting and related events are described in detail by A. J. Ranasinghe, Dr. Nandadasa Kodagoda and Sunil Santha. After the audition Sunil Santha brought Amaradewa to stay at Chitrasena Studios, his room mate was A. J. Ranasinghe.By chance filming of the film Ashokamala commenced nearby. Gerard J. Pieris of Moratuwa introduced Amaradeva to Mohamed Ghouse Master who was handling the music for the film and Ghouse recognising Amaradeva's skill enlisted him as the top violinist in his orchestra. Amardeva left his studies and accompanied Ghouse to India to work on the film. He would play a triple role of singing, dancing and acting on the film with the song \"Ayi Yameku Kale Ale.\"CareerHe found steady work as an artist on Radio Ceylon, where his unique vision and talent could be exhibited to an audience wider than he had ever before known \u2013 earning him a position at the Bhatkhande Music Institute in Lucknow, India. In 1955, Amaradeva won the All India violin competition. After extensive training, Albert returned to Sri Lanka as \nPandit\n Wannakuwatta waduge Don Amaradeva.The name Amaradeva which translates as Immortal god was given to him by Prof. Ediriweera Sarachchandra (Sri Lanka's foremost playwright and a close associate).During this time, Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) had only begun emerging as an independent nation, and the question of \nwhat\n Sri Lankan music was, was slowly being addressed with equal vigour by intellectuals, artists and the general public. In response to the spirit of these times, Amaradeva began interweaving indigenous folk music with the North Indian ragas he had studied in Lucknow, thereby giving expression to a more sophisticated cadence.His other innovations include his experimentation with Western harmonies and counter-harmonies, as well as with South Indian and Tamil musical forms. In the song 'Ran Dahadiya Bindu Bindu', Amaradeva incorporated the Baila music of his hometown. His opus, however, remains the work he did with Sri Lanka's celebrated lyricist Mahagama Sekera, in exploring the contours of fusing classical Sinhala poetry with his unique musical intonation. In time, Amaradeva's music came to reflect an entire philosophy, reflective of the spirit of a nation.He has composed music for ballet (Karadiya, Nala Damayanthi, etc.), film (Ranmuthu Duwa, Gam Peraliya, Ran Salu, Delovak Athara, Gatavarayo, Rena Girav, Thun Man Handiya, Puran Appu, etc.), theatre (Wessantara, etc.), radio and television. He is the creator of the mando-harp, a musical instrument combining the mandolin and the harp.Amaradeva is credited as having introduced artists such as Nanda Malini and Edward Jayakody to the wider audience. Many artists such as Sunil Edirisinghe, Victor Ratnayake and Neela Wickramasinghe have credited him as a major influence on their work. Dr. Lester James Peries has described his voice as the greatest musical instrument. Amaradeva has also been described as the defining musician of Sinhala civilization for his role in the creation of a national tradition.Amaradeva was married to Wimala, together they had one son (Ranjana Amaradeva), and two daughters (Subhani Amaradeva, herself a talented vocalist, and Priyanvada Amaradeva). He was a patron of numerous charities.DeathAmaradeva was admitted to Sri Jayawaradanapura Teaching Hospital due to a sudden illness. He died at the age of 88 on 3 November 2016 while receiving treatment at the Intensive Care Unit. The cause of death was a heart failure. The government subsequently announced that a state funeral would be held with a week of national mourning. His remains were given state honours at the Independence Memorial Hall for two days, the first time in the country's history where remains were kept at the Independence Memorial Hall.HonoursFilmographyMusic directorTrack listingSingle song tracks released"}, {"name": "Karunarathna Divulgane", "info": "Sri Lankan musician and politician", "Intro": "Sri Lankan musician and politician", "Is": "Singer", "From": "Sri Lanka", "Type": "Music", "Gender": "male", "description": "Karunarathna Divulgane\n is a singer and a classical musician in Sri Lanka.

She made it to the silver screen via the stage and had acted in close to 100 films, at the time of her death. Having an equal passion for singing as well as a melodious voice, she was Sri Lanka's foremost female singer in the gramophone era. After her death, she was awarded the Sarasaviya 'Rana Thisara'- Life Time Achievement Award at the 1979 Sarasaviya Awards Festival.Background\n \nRukmani Devi, was born as Daisy Rasammah Daniels to a Tamil Colombo Chetty Christian family on 15 January 1923 at Ramboda in Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka. Second, in a family of five, her father, John Daniel worked on a plantation and her mother, Helen Rose was a teacher.\n \nShe grew up in Colombo and had her early education at St. Matthew's School and then moved on to St. Clare's School, Wellawatte.\n \nAs a little girl, Daniels showed an inborn talent to sing and dance. At the age of seven, she was picked to sing Christmas carols. Impressed with her ability to sing, dance, and also to act, she was selected to perform a main role in a Christmas play, 'The Shoemaker's Wife'.\n \nThe stage play was trained and presented by St. Clare's School, Wellawatte.\n \nWatching her play this role much enthusiastically, Walter Abeysinghe, a drama producer sought permission from her father, to invite her to play the lead role of 'Sita' in his drama 'Ramayanaya.' Thus, in 1935 at the age of just 12 years she performed in this stage play, presented by the 'Sinhala Natya Sabha'.\n \nShe was married to veteran dramatist, actor and singer, Eddie Jayamanne, whom she fell in love with as a result of her close association with him, when performing in dramas produced by \"Minerva Dramatic Club\" founded by B. A. W. Jayamanne. They lived at \"Jaya Ruk\", at Angurukaramulla, Negombo.\n Career\n \nThis marked the beginning of an illustrious career that would span over four decades. As her performances were highly appreciated by the packed audience, well-known dramatist Dick Dias chose her for two of his stage plays, \"Jana Kiharanaya\" and \"Mayawathie\". She was now flooded with stage dramas, as she became Mayawathi in Charles Dias' 'Mayawathi', Juliet in a Sinhala adaption of Romeo and Juliet, playing the lead female role in all of them.\n \nWith her first audio recording of the famous song \"Siri Buddhagaya Vihare\" with Master \n\"H. W. Rupasinghe\"\n.\n\u00a0\n in 1938, she captured the hearts of the masses and she shaped her career from that of an actress to that of an actress turned singer. This song was recorded to 78 rpm (gramophone) record label HMV with the number N-9300 and issued in 1939 by the Cargills Ltd, local agents for HMV\n \nHer unique voice attracted many music directors, as her singing career moved from the stage to the silver screen.\n \nIt was also, around this time that her name underwent a change from Daisy Daniels to the well known 'Rukmani Devi'. There are two schools of thinking as to how the name \"Rukmani Devi\" originated. According to one school, the late H. W. Rupasinghe maestro created the name, while the other believe that Jayantha Weerasekara and Michael Sannas Liyanage who is in his 90s, created it.\n \nB. A. W. Jayamanne, founder of \"Minerva Dramatic Club\" of Negombo took Rukmani to perform remarkable roles in his interestingly featured dramas, such as 'Apparition', 'Broken Promise', 'Changing Fate, 'Defeated Aim', 'Evasive Denial', 'Fanatic Faith', 'Grisly Guardian', 'Hasty Decision' and lastly 'Irangani'. Above-mentioned plays followed the English alphabet.\n \nThe popular play 'Broken Promise' (Kadawunu Poronduwa), was adapted into a film by B. A. W. Jayamanne. This was the first Sinhala film \u2013 Kadawunu Poronduwa, screened on 21 January 1947. Rukmani Devi, who also began her film career through the role of 'Ranjani' in this film, also became the first local cinema actress. Her film career, which thus began spread over a period of more than three decades.\n \nAccording to \nSri Lankeya Cinema Vanshaya\n (pp 637 \u2013 638) written by Nuwan Nayanajith Kumara, from \nKadawunu Poronduwa\n in 1947 to \nAra Soyza\n in 1984, Rukmani Devi had played different roles in 99 films, up to the time of her death.\n \nAn equally talented singer, some of the immortal songs she sang for films are \nSandyave Sriya\n for 'Kadawunu Poronduwa', \nPinsara Mage Soyura\n for 'Kapati Arakshakaya', \nGala Kandeni\n, and \nMoranawa Preme Hade\n for 'Weradun Kurumanama', \nNindede Rathri Yahane\n for 'Peralena Iranama', \nMavila Pena vi Rupe\n for 'Kela Handa', \nPem Sihina Loke Maya\n for 'Mathabhedaya', \nMelavi Yanna Hada Mage\n for 'Daiva Yogaya', \nSuva dena Sita Sanasum\n for 'Ladalu' and \nDoi Doi Puta\n for 'Ahasin Polavata'.\n \nIn 1975 Rukmani sing \"Pem Rajatahane\" with Miton Mallawarachchi.\n \nIn the mid sixties she joined the sinhala calypso musical group 'Los Cabelleros' led by late Neville Fernando. They recorderd ever popular sinhala songs such as 'Malbara Himidiriye','Menike Obe sinawe' & 'Sandak nage'.\n \nRukmani Devi was also featured prominently on the airwaves of Radio Ceylon, the oldest radio station in South Asia.\n Death\n \nRukmani Devi, died in a tragic motor accident near St. Mary's Church, Thudella on 28 October 1978. She was returning after a musical show in Uyanwatte, Matara. Her funeral ceremony was attended by a very large gathering; film makers and dramatists, friends, politicians, relatives and her beloved fans.\n \nShe was the most celebrated Sri Lankan artiste and a statue in memory of her was erected at the Kanuwana Junction, Ja-Ela, as she still lives in the hearts and minds of the Sri Lankan people. The road on which the Rukmani Devi Museum in Negombo is located was also renamed 'Rukmani Devi Mawatha' by President Ranasinghe Premadasa, on 28 October 1990.\n Awards\n \n \nBest background Singer for the song 'Doi doiya putha' in the film 'Ahasin Polawata' at the inaugural Presidential Awards Ceremony in 1976.\n \nBest actress Award for 'Kele Handa' at the 'Deepasika' awards ceremony conducted by 'Lankadipa' Newspaper in 1956.\n \nVoted Best Actress with a majority of 16,221 votes at the 'Reader's Contest' conducted by 'Dinamina' Newspaper in 1955.\n \n In popular culture\n \nShe was the one and only Sri Lankan actress on the cover page of popular Indian Film Magazine \"Filmfare\" and was also featured in \"My like and dislike\" in 1958 in the Filmfare. The Toyota Hi-ace First generation model is known in Sri Lanka as the 'Rukmani Model', because she was travelling in one when she had her fatal accident.\n Attack on Grave Site\n \nOn 12 August 2011, a former Mayor of Negombo and a Former Minister of the Parliament Mr. Ananda Munasinghe was allegedly charged and arrested by the Negombo Police for Dislodging the Statue of Rukmani Devi, erected on her grave by one of her fans Mrs. Sriyani Achala Dissanayake. Several popular media bloated this incident as an attack by an unidentified group of criminals to Rukmani Devi's grave and a protest rally to this incident was also organised in Negombo on 14 August 2011. However, later it was revealed that Mr. Ananda Munasinghe who is also the Son-in-Law of Bernard Aloysius Jayamanne (B. A. W. Jayamanne) is in fact the present owner of this grave and he has dislodged the statue to erect a proper statue of Rukmani Devi as the statue which was erected earlier was a disrespect to the beauty and looks of Rukmani Devi.\n \nThe grave Rukmani Devi is buried is the ancestral family plot of the Jayamanne family and all her in-laws are buried there. This can be seen on the tombstone erected and is evident on the deed title held by the family. The statue erected by \"Mrs. Sriyani Achala Dissanayake\" was a cheap publicity stunt to restore her lost fame to make a living. She did not take approval from the family nor informed the family. She fabricated this attack story by providing \"favours\" to the right people in law and publicity\n Other films\n \n \nAbudasse kale (1968)\n \n "}, {"name": "Nimal Mendis", "info": "Sri Lankan musician", "Intro": "Sri Lankan musician", "Was": "Singer\nMusician\nSongwriter", "From": "Sri Lanka", "Type": "Music", "Gender": "male", "Birth": "29 March 1934", "Death": "16 April 2015\n(aged 81 years)", "description": "Nimal Mendis\n (1934-2015) was a Sri Lankan singer and songwriter, and was one of a handful of Sri Lankan musicians to appear on the BBC television programme \nTop of the Pops\n (1968). Mendis was a longstanding member of the Performing Rights Society and the Mechanical Copyright Protection Society of Great Britain.Mendis was discovered in the late 1950s by Radio Ceylon, which dominated the airwaves in South Asia in the era. The station backed Mendis' songs from the outset, including \"Kandyan Express\", turning them into hits in South Asia: so much so that listeners from all over the Indian sub-continent wrote in to Radio Ceylon requesting his songs.Mendis had been involved with music from his early childhood, and has lived for many years in London travelling often to Sri Lanka. He has also lived at Le Paradis in the Charente, the South West of France, for five years with his wife Ranjani. Mendis was married to Ranjani for 33 years until her death in 2010, and has one son, Paulmarie, with whom Mendis ran Mediaeye Productions.The devastation of the 2004 tsunami moved Mendis, leading him to compose a song to aid the victims. This was recorded in Australia, Sri Lanka and the United Kingdom, and was commended by the British Parliament in early day motion 638, sponsored by MP Linda Perham.BiographyEarly years: 1950s\u20131960sMendis has 22 songs published in Britain and has written music for films in Sri Lanka. \"Kiss Kiss Kiss\" was Mendis's first song that was recorded in Britain and sung by Mary Marshall on the Columbia label. \"Kandyan Express\", \"Cherry Blossom Tree\", \"Oh My Lover\", \"Butterfly in the Rain\", \"Champagne Blues\", and \"Goodnight Kisses \"' were number-one hits in Sri Lanka in the late fifties.\"Kandyan Dance\", an instrumental, was his second piece in the West. Recorded by Friedel Berlipp and his Orchestra in Germany it went on to be number two on Radio Luxembourg. It was also released in the United States. \nBlack Pearls & Green Diamonds\n has eight of Mendis's songs on an LP for Decca by One Two and Three, a folk group in Britain. This album is now a collectors item.Mendis appeared on the popular BBC television music programme \nTop of the Pops\n with his singing partner Sandra Edema in 1968 as guest artists with his song \"Feel like a Clown\". The B-side of the record \"Rainbow Land\" was the A-side in the States and today (2013), it has become a collector's item in the Psychedelic Rock community in the west. They were also featured with the song on \nBeat Club\n in Germany that year. Eugene Wright, bass player with the original Dave Brubeck Quartet, arranged and recorded five of Mendis's songs with only him playing bass. He also arranged and produced one other song, \"Singing Fish\", with electric guitar, bass, and piano. They were sung by Sandra Edema.1970sMendis recorded a number of songs in London, mostly of a spiritual nature. He also made a twenty-minute audio documentary on the Way of the Cross called \nThe Passion Report\n; another audio documentary called \nFerryman\n focused on the tea estate-worker and the farmer in Sri Lanka, tracing their history from the British colonial period. He also wrote \nBread of Life\n for the Eucharistic Congress in Sri Lanka.Mendis has written several memorable songs for Sri Lankan films, most notably \"Master Sir\" for the film \nKalu Diya Dhahara\n (\"A column of black water\"), where Neela Wickramasinghe performed it over the title sequence. \"Master Sir\" is about colonial Sri Lanka, narrating a story about the dignity of labour- a story about social justice. The song was recorded both in English (by Mendis and Sandra Edema) and Sinhala (by Neville Fernando; lyrics translated to Sinhala by Karunaratne Abeysekera). The song has remained a hit in Sri Lanka for over thirty years, mostly as a result of Neela Wickramasinghe's popularized version based on the musical arrangement of the English version (time signature, riffs etc.).His composition \nGanga Addara\n (\"By the Banks of the River\"), translated into Sinhala by Augustus Vinayagaratnam, and sung by Vijaya Kumaranatunga, for the film of the same name (directed by Sumitra Peiris), is also popular. The hit \nRan Tikiri Sina\n was written for the same film and sung by Victor Silva and Nirasha Perera. In 2013 a new version of the song \"Ganga Addara\" was sung by Surendra Perera and used as the theme song for a teledrama series of the same name. \"Upul Nuwan\" was another classic composed for the 1978 Lester James Peiris film \nWhite Flowers for the Dead\n.1980sIn the 1980s, Mendis went into the production of documentary films with his wife- their son Paulmarie, deft with computers and editing visuals, assisted them. He was only seven years old when he accompanied his parents filming in the war zones of the North and East of Sri Lanka. Mendis also did a stageshow \nIt's What I Am\n with Sri Lankan musicians; the highlight was the song \"July '83\", based on the ethnic riots of that year. He also made two audio cassettes, one for Air Lanka- \nA Taste of Paradise\n, and the other for the Ceylon Tourist Board- \nPilgrim Places of Sri Lanka\n.1990s-2015The Mendis family formed their own enterprise, Mediaeye Music Lanka (PVT) Ltd., which released an audio documentary, \nWar is my Country\n, in 2000, tracing the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka up to 1994. This CD contained archive material over a period of seventeen years with narration, interviews with political and other personalities, songs and poems.Together with his son, Paulmarie, Mendis continued to compile songs, audio documentaries and film material on CD and DVD. Through Mediaeye, they worked closely with various large organisations in Sri Lanka, working on projects such as Sirasa Superstar (Sri Lanka's equivalent of American Idol/Xfactor) and interacting with many young artists in the country. In 2009 they completed a ten-minute piece for Sri Lankan Airlines showcasing the company's new uniforms; this, as well as one of Mendis' songs \"And A Star\" by Generation 4 (four of the Sirasa Superstars), which was used by the airline as a boarding video in 2011 and again during Christmas 2013.Mendis wrote three songs for Sumitra Peries' film \"Vaishnavee\" as well as the background score, which was arranged and produced by Paulmarie.In 2013 he wrote the first ever Sinhala blues song, \"Girls\", which was sung by Amila Sandaruwan. It was translated into Sinhala by Duminda Allahendra who has also translated some of Mendis's new material. The music video for the song was produced by the students of the Digital Film Institute of Sri Lanka.Mendis died on 16 April 2015 at a private hospital in Malabe, Colombo, at the age of 81.Television documentariesDawn of Terror\n, Mendis' first documentary, focused on the country's ethnic conflict, and is regarded an anti-war film. It was made for the Centre for Society and Religion in Sri Lanka and despite being produced on VHS was taken for distribution by Concord Video and Film in the UK.Shattered Pearl\n spotlighted women affected by the war in Sri Lanka and the \"right to life\" was made for Channel 4 television in London. It was a major film by Sri Lankans on British TV at the time. It has been shown in many parts of the world.Three Women Speak Out\n was made for \"Article 19\" in Britain, on the freedom of opinion and expression. Mediaeye also edited \nZ for Zero Concern\n on homeless children in London for the Children's Society.Water Water Everywhere\n, filmed in Bangladesh, is on women and water-management, made for CAFOD.Blessed Are the Poor\n compares poverty in Britain and South India and the positive effort people make to change their lives. This documentary was made for the Methodist International.Mediaeye has also served as researchers for three major British TV productions. Three of their documentaries were at the Monticatini Film Festival in Italy: \nShattered Pearl\n, \nSeyllan to Paradise\n, and \nStop Killing Start Singing\n (which was based on three songs). It was the first time that Sinhala songs were featured as a documentary."}, {"name": "Kamal Addararachchi", "info": "Sri lankan singer", "Intro": "Sri lankan singer", "Is": "Singer", "From": "Sri Lanka", "Type": "Music", "Gender": "male", "Birth": "5 February 1962, Sri Lanka", "Age": "59 years", "description": "\nKamal Addararachchi\n - \u0d9a\u0db8\u0dbd\u0dca \u0d85\u0daf\u0dca\u0daf\u0dbb\u0d86\u0dbb\u0da0\u0dca\u0da0\u0dd2 (born Addararachchige Gunendra Kamal on 5 February 1962) is an award-winning Sri Lankan film and teledrama actor, singer and presenter.

Abeyratne's \nSurathalee\n, singing \"Siriyame Sara\", in 1956. Prior to that, he had recorded a song for the late Sirisena Wimalaweera's \nPodi Putha\n.

Later when \nSurathalee\n producer Jabir A. Cader wanted to hear one of his songs to consider him for the film, Jothipala almost passed on the offer as he did not possess enough money to create a record. He was helped out by veteran musician Stanley Omar who financed him for the sum of 35 rupees \u2013 a large amount of money at the time.

But while singing he felt pain, but finished the singing successfully. Next day he was admitted to the hospital. Jothipala died on 7 July 1987 at Ratnams Private Hospital.

We told him time after time not to drink anymore,\" Ramya Fleming, a nurse who worked at the hospital at the time, was quoted saying after his death.

The song became an instant hit in South Asia and to this day it is sung by Annesley Malewana on his world tours.\n \nWijewardena composed a song for the son of Vijaya Corea and it was titled as \"Viran Bilindhu Puthe\" After that Wijewardena changed the chorus part of the song and sang that song as Kiri Muhuda Kalabala. Also Wijewardena composed a song for the son of Chanaka and Lankika Perera and it was titled as \"Sihina Pathum Wimane\" Also the song \"Bethlehempure\" which was written by Sri Lanka's famed lyricist, Mr Karunaratne Abeysekera, became an instant hit on the island.

Wijewardena also composed 'Naththal Seeya' in the early 1970s.\n \nWijewardena's first solo is 'Dileepa podi puthu' was written by Radio Ceylon broadcaster, Karunaratne Abeysekera for his own son. Wijewardena appreciated the work of Karu and wrote an instant song Seetha Pawan to express his gratitude on the day of the funeral of Karunaratne Abeysekera.\n Film music\n \nWijewardena entered the film music industry at that time. The first film with music directed by Wijewardena was 'Sikuruliya' and the sound track was supplied by the Golden Chimes - the film includes a scene where Wijewardena and the Golden Chimes perform at a party.

During that time he directed music for a number of artists in Sri Lanka. He also produced a cassette tape named \"Clarence with the Rising Stars\".\n Directing music for tele dramas\n \nWijewardena directed music for the tele dramas Susima and Nidikumba Mal. He was the composer and the music director for all the six songs of Susima tele drama. During this time he got a special chance. That he was able to compose and direct music for Pandit Amaradewa. That song was Sasara Gewa Yana Diwi Gamane which contained in tele drama Nidikumba Mal. Also he composed and music directed a song which says about child abuse and other prohibited things happen in present society. That song was \"Daesawan Dase\" which contained in the Sihiwatana II Cassette Tape.

During the 1980s, he composed and directed music for a number of songs and performed with well-known music directors in Sri Lanka.\n \nAll of Wijewardena's compositions have been recorded at some of the island's best recording studios and under the best producing labels in Sri Lanka. Some of the early 1960s recordings were at Augie Ranaweera's studio in Bambalapitiya.\n Later career\n \n \n \n \n Clarence with 3 Sisters.\n \n \n \nWijewardena organised three musical shows with his lifelong friend Annesley Malewana and Indrani Perera at BMICH in Colombo.\n \nWijewardena proved to be quite a hit in London when broadcaster Vernon Corea broadcast his music on BBC Radio London 206 on his popular radio programme, \nLondon Sounds Eastern\n. Wijewardena and Annesley frequently toured the United Kingdom in the 1980s playing to huge audiences in London.\n Controversy\n \nHowever, due to the popularity of his songs (which has grown since his death), they have also become the subject of a lawsuit over illegally recorded renditions sampled by other Sri Lankan artists. Wijewardena's widow Sheela Wijewardana in 2001 filed suit against Rajiv Sebastian, hoping to recover a portion of the income earned through the use of her late husband's work. An action doomed to failure due to the non availability of evidence on the part of the complainant. Since the lawsuit against Rajiv and Sarath Kothalawela, Sheela filed a wrongful lawsuit against Clarences long time friend and musical partner Annesley Malawana and lost it with no recourse. To this date, she has been unable to establish her rightful claims as the legitimate or legal heir to his intellectual property.\n Music\n \nSri Lanka's musician, Clarence Wijewardena, composed and sang over 1000 of songs but 40% of them were not released because the master recordings were under the custody of record producers. Some of the songs were released to the market without any authorized label after his death. They did not get the attention of his fans because they were considered to be illegal and most of the FM broadcasting channels in Sri Lanka were not aware of them. It is unfortunate that most of these songs are not released officially and Wijewardena did not get the due credit for them.\n \nWijewardena spent more of his composing time for his fellow singers and he had never been offered the credit for them.\n \nIn the course of his career, Wijewardena wrote several songs that became classics in his own time - among these; \nGamen Liyumak\n (Translated: A Letter From the Village), \nHiruge Lowedi\n (Translated: In the World of the Sun), \nKanda Surinduni\n (\"O Lord God of the Mountain\"),\nPiyaneni\n (\"Father\"), and \nMalata Bambaraku Se\n (Translated: Like a Bee To a Flower)\n Death\n \n \n \n \n Stone memorial (Tomb) of Clarance Wijewardana at Borella cemetery.\n \n \n \nWijewardena died on 13 December 1996, at the age of 53, in Sri Lanka after a long struggle against ruptured gastric ulcers and gangrene due to accute Diabetes.\n Legacy\n \nMany of his songs are considered classics, and continue to enjoy ample airtime on Sri Lankan television and radio broadcasts and on some overseas radio stations. The songs such as Rasa Pirunu Katha, Geeyakin Kese, Eatha Ran Wiman Yowun Sihina Loke, etc are very popular among present generation which again demonstrated his talent in composing music (also as a lyricist) for the future.\n "}, {"name": "Freddie Silva", "info": "Sri Lankan actor-singer", "Intro": "Sri Lankan actor-singer", "Was": "Singer", "From": "Sri Lanka", "Type": "Music", "Gender": "male", "Birth": "18 May 1938, Moratuwa", "Death": "29 October 2001\n(aged 63 years)", "description": "Halpeliyanage Morris Joseph de Silva, popularly as Freddy Silva (Sinhala: \u0dc6\u0dd9\u200d\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0da9\u0dd3 \u0dc3\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dcf) (1938\u20132001), was a Sri Lankan film actor, and a playback singer, who appeared from 1973 until 2002. Freddie is known as the most popular Sri Lankan comedian of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. He appeared in over 450 films of which 300 were screened at the celebration of fifty years in Sinhala Cinema). \nBiography\n \nEarly life\n \nSilva was born Halpeliyanage Morris Joseph de Silva in Puvakaramba, Moratuwa an only child. Silva's father was an overseer for the Moratuwa Urban Council and his mother was a member of Salvation Army. Growing up he was fascinated with singing and dancing.\n \nMusician\n \nIn the 1950s Silva performed the Alanson Mendis composition \"Bar Bar Bar\" in front of Sir John Kotelawala and was warmly received. He used this opportunity to get a letter of recommendation from Kotelawala which he presented to Livy Wijemanne of Radio Ceylon to secure a job as a radio artist.\n \nSilva's first recording was \"Mottapala.\" He followed the song with \"Bar Bar Bar\" now updated with music by P. L. A. Somapala. It was a success. Subsequent efforts teamed Silva with the late Premakirthi de Alwis. Their work include comedic songs like \"Aron Mama\", \"Pankiritta\", \"Nedeyo\", \"Handa Mama\", \"Kekille Rajjuruwo\" and \"Parana Coat\" (from \nLokuma Hinawa\n). Silva's crowning achievement is considered the tune \"Kundumani.\"\n \nActor\n \nSilva got his first screen role through a chance meeting with K. A. W. Perera in 1963. At that time he was living with H. R. Jothipala and Roy de Silva and frequented parties as a guest entertainer. Perera cast Silva in \nSuhada Sohoyuro\n alongside L. S. Ramachandran and Vijitha Mallika. He appeared at a dance on the beach singing \"Diya rella verale hapi hapi\" and went on to be cast in mainly comedic roles.\n \nThe serious side of Silva was seen in \nSekaya\n (1965), \nLasanda\n (1974) and \nSukiri kella\n (1975). In the 1975 film he played a mentally handicapped character and in preparation for the role lived with a real handicapped boy in Koralawella.\n \nBy the 1980s, producers were reluctant to make a film without Silva fearing that the movie would flop. He was then living an extravagant life and saved little. In 1989 Silva was awarded the Ranathisara award by leading film weekly Sarasaviya. A turning moment came when his friend Vijaya Kumaratunga (who he appeared alongside in ten films the last being \nYukthiyada Shakthiyada\n) was murdered. He cites this event as leading to the downfall of cinema. Still Silva stayed busy appearing in 15 of the 26 films made in 1992.\n \nBy the late-'90s Silva received no work and lived in poverty with a pension of 2000 rupees from the Sri Lankan Film Corporation. He called his home a broken down garage that served as bed room, living room and kitchen on Emmanuel Church Road, Rawatawatte. Silva died on 29 October 2001.\n Family\n \nFreddie Silva was a father of two children, his son Janesh Silva, was also an actor and a singer. He died on June 10, 2012 while he was taking medical treatments for cancer. Janesh Silva is known as a comedian that acted in 10+ films. Freddie's daughter Chandani Silva is a singer and actress.

W. R. D. Bandaranaike and Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Vijaya Kumaranatunga and Chandrika Bandaranaike had two children, Yasodhara Kumaranatunga Walker, a UK-based physician, and Vimukthi Kumaranatunga, a vet.\n Cinema career\n \nKumaranatunga's first film was \nHanthane Kathawa\n, in which he played the lead role. Since then, in a career that spanned nearly two decades, he acted in 114 films including \nEya Den Loku Lamayek\n (1975), \nPonmani\n (1977), \nBambaru Avith\n (1977), \nGanga Addara\n (1980), \nBaddegama\n (1980), Paradige (1980), Maha Gedara (1980), Kedapathaka Chaya (1989) and Kristhu Charithaya (1990). He also won several awards. He won the most popular actors award in Sri Lanka from 1983 to 1988. That was a record in the history of Sri Lankan cinema. He was posthumously awarded as the best actor for the role he played in \nKedapathaka Chaya\n. He performed as a playback singer as well in several films and won the Best Playback Singer Award for two times (For \"Saharawe Sihinya\" Movie - \"Walakulak Gena Muwa Karamu Hiru.....\" & \"Dolosmahe Pahana\" Movie- \"Sara Guwana Wida Neguna.....\"). Also, he sang more than 100 songs by releasing nearly 10 cassettes (Ganga Addara, Kawluwa Atharin, Vedana, Dinakara Paya, Vijaya Gee, Seetha Reyedi, Mangala Nekatha, Sudu Duwa, Roossa Gaha Langa). He sang all his songs without taking any money. During his career, Vijaya performed in one English film, \nThe God King\n, and one Tamil film, \nNanguran\n. The only film he produced was \nWaradata Danduwam\n, which was screened after his death.\n Political career\n \nHe was also a politician, who started his political life in the Lanka Sama Samaja Party. He later joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and was SLFP's 1st National Organizer and unsuccessfully contested the Katana seat in 1977. He was active in the presidential campaign of Hector Kobbekaduwa in 1982. After the election, he was jailed under the emergency regulations by J.R Jayawardena for allegedly being a \"Naxalite\" (a political creed hitherto and henceforth unknown in Sri Lanka), but he was never charged. He contested Mahara by-election under SLFP candidature in 1983 and was maltreated by UNP supporters. An attempt was made on his life and one of his friends was killed. Vijaya won the first round of counting and a second round was ordered. At that point an infamous blackout occurred at the counting centre. By the time electricity was restored, the UNP candidate had recorded a victory by a few votes. The opposition insisted that someone had literally \"eaten some of Vijaya's votes to ensure UNP victory\".\n \nHe founded the Sri Lanka Mahajana Party (SLMP). He and his party argued for peace in the then ongoing civil war in Sri Lanka. He contested the Minneriya by-election under the newly elected SLMP and recorded the second place in the competition that was won by the UNP candidate however sending his old party SLFP to a humiliating third position. His party then contested at several by-elections including Kundasale and Habaraduwa but did not live up to expectations. In his final public address Kumaratunga who had a political mission - one that transcended political barriers expressed his unconcealed dislike for feudalistic politics of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), a party that failed to sustain his interest due to its sheer lack of liberal thinking. Addressing the mammoth public rally held at Campbell Park on January 28, 1988, Kumaratunga lashed out at the UNP, SLFP and the JVP for failing to address the need of the hour. Interestingly, Kumaratunga also voiced his concerns about the SLFP's links with the JVP. In 1988 his party came to a concillation with several other left wing parties including LSSP, NSSP, Sri Lanka Communist Party and EPRLF to form a new alliance-United Socialist alliance(USA). A few days prior to the establishment of the new alliance,Vijaya was assassinated. The agreement for USA was signed by the party leaders at his funeral ceremony.USA won a large number of seats in the newly erected provincial councils in an election that was boycotted by the main opposition SLFP. Later USA forwarded Ossie Abeygoonasekera as its presidential candidate and he would record the last place at the presidential elections in 1988. USA contested at the 1989 Parliamentary Elections and won three seats including one from the national list however all the winners represented member parties of USA other than SLMP.\n 1986 Jaffna Visit\n \nin 1986, Vijaya Kumaranatunga visited Jaffna which was under LTTE Control. A rare video shows that he visited Nallur Murugan Temple and met the local Tamil civilians. He met several Youth LTTE Leaders before returning to Lankan Military Camp.\n Death and legacy\n \nKumaranatunga was shot in the head with a Type 56 assault rifle outside his residence in the outskirts of Colombo on 16 February 1988 at 12.20pm by Lionel Ranasinghe alias Gamini, who later confessed to the murder upon being questioned by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). Ranasinghe, in a 141-page statement, confessed that he was merely carrying out orders given to him by the Deshapremi Janatha Viyaparaya (DJV)/Patriotic People's Movement, the military arm of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (People's Liberation Front), a Marxist organization which is responsible for assassinations during the late 1980s. However, the Presidential Commission report had concluded that President Ranasinghe Premadasa, Gamini Lokuge and the Deputy Minister of Defence Ranjan Wijeratne of the United National Party had been behind the Vijaya Kumaratunga assassination. Kumaratunga's widow Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga also holds this view. Kumaratunga's funeral had attracted the most number of people for a funeral in Sri Lanka. Vijaya's coffin was only partly opened (the head part was closed due to damage sustained during the assassination). The funeral was held at the Independence Square in Colombo on 21 February 1988 as a state funeral, though he represented the opposition arena against the UNP government. It was the first ever funeral ceremony to be telecast live on a Sri Lankan TV Channel (by Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation). Twelve people reportedly committed suicide after hearing of his death. His assassination day (16 February 1988) is widely known as the \"The Horrible Tuesday\" or \"The Darkest Tuesday in Sri Lankan History\". Kumaranatunga's death is still mourned by many people in Sri Lanka.\n Filmography\n \n \n \nYear\n \nFilm\n \nRole\n \nNotes\n \n \n \n1967\n \nManamalayo\n \n \nActing debut\n \n \n \n1969\n \nRomio Juliet Kathawak\n \n \n \n \n \nHanthane Kathawa\n \n \n \n \n \n1970\n \nPriyanga\n \n \n \n \n \n1971\n \nRan Onchilla\n \n \n \n \n \nAbirahasa\n \n \n \n \n \nKesara Sinhayo\n \n \n \n \n \nHatharadenama Soorayo\n \n \n \n \n \nSamanala Kumariyo Samaga Api Kawadath Soorayo\n \n \n \n \n \nBindunu Hadawath\n \n \nAlso film's producer\n \n \n \n1977\n \nMe Desa Kumatada\n \n \n \n \n \nEdath Sooraya Adath Sooraya\n \n \n \n \n \nVana Raja\n \n \n \n \n \nAdare Hithenawa Dakkama\n \n \n \n \n \nThushara\n \nSampath\n \n \n \n \nHaddinnath Tharu\n \n \n \n \n \nDahakin Ekek\n \n \n \n \n \nHondama Welawa\n \n \n \n \n \n1974\n \nSusi\n \n \n \n \n \nAhas Gauwa\n \n \n \n \n \nDuleeka\n \n \n \n \n \nSanakeliya\n \n \n \n \n \nThe God King\n \nLalith\n \nEnglish Film\n \n \n \n1975\n \nPem Kurullo\n \n \n \n \n \nSikuruliya\n \n \n \n \n \nLassana Dawasak\n \n \n \n \n \nSangeetha\n \n \n \n \n \n1976\n \nPradeepe Ma Weva\n \n \n \n \n \nVasana\n \n \n \n \n \nDiyamanthi\n \n \n \n \n \nUnnath Dahai Malath Dahai\n \n \n \n \n \nAdarei Man Adarei\n \n \n \n \n \n1977\n \nSakunthala\n \n \n \n \n \nHithuvoth Hithuvamai\n \n \n \n \n \nMaruwa Samaga Wase\n \nMaru Sira\n \n \n \n \nHariyanakota Ohoma Thamai\n \n \n \n \n \nEya Den Loku Lamayek\n \n \n \n \n \nPembara Madhu\n \n \n \n \n \n1978\n \nVishmaya\n \n \n \n \n \nKundala Keshi\n \n \n \n \n \nSandawata Ran Tharu\n \n \n \n \n \nAnupama\n \n \n \n \n \nSelinge Walawuwa\n \n \n \n \n \nBambaru Awith\n \nVictor\n \n \n \n \nSally\n \n \n \n \n \nKumara Kumariyo\n \n \n \n \n \nAhasin Polowata\n \n \n \n \n \n1979\n \nGahaniyak\n \n \n \n \n \nPodi Malli\n \n \n \n \n \nHingana Kolla\n \n \n \n \n \nMonarathenna\n \n \n \n \n \nEka Hitha\n \n \n \n \n \nAkke Mata Awasara\n \n \n \n \n \n1980\n \nRaja Dawasak\n \n \n \n \n \nGanga Addara\n \nDr. Sarath Pathirana\n \n \n \n \nKarumakkarayo\n \n \n \n \n \nKinduru Kumari\n \n \n \n \n \nPara Dige\n \nChandre\n \n \n \n \nTak Tik Tuk\n \n \n \n \n \nKanchana\n \n \n \n \n \n1981\n \nBeddegama\n \nBabun\n \nBased on Leonard Wolf's \"Baddegama\"\n \n \n \nGithika\n \n \n \n \n \nAnjana\n \n \n \n \n \nSuriyakantha\n \n \n \n \n \nValampuri\n \n \n \n \n \n1982\n \nYasa Isuru\n \n \n \n \n \nMihidum Sihina\n \n \n \n \n \nRahasak Nathi Rahasak\n \n \n \n \n \nMaha Gedara\n \n \n \n \n \nKadawunu Poronduwa (New)\n \nSamson\n \n \n \n \nNewatha Hamuwemu\n \n \n \n \n \nParamitha\n \n \n \n \n \n1983\n \nSamanala Sihina\n \n \n \n \n \nSivu Rangasena\n \n \n \n \n \nPasta Mithuro\n \n \n \n \n \nSandamali\n \n \n \n \n \n1984\n \nKokila\n \n \n \n \n \nJaya Sikurui\n \n \n \n \n \nBinaree Saha Audu Banda\n \n \n \n \n \nWelle Thenu Maliga\n \n \n \n \n \n1986\n \nDevuduwa\n \n \n \n \n \nPeralikarayo\n \nVijay/Samson\n \nDual Role\n \n \n \nJaya Apitai\n \n \n \n \n \nGimhane Gee Naade\n \n \n \n \n \n1987\n \nYugayen Yugayata\n \n \n \n \n \nYukthiyada Sakthiyada\n \n \n \n \n \nKavuluva\n \n \n \n \n \nRaja Wedakarayo\n \n \n \n \n \nRandamwel\n \n \n \n \n \nObatai Priye Adare\n \n \nRavi\n \n \n \n \n \nAhinsa\n \n \n \n \n \n1989\n \nMamai Raja\n \n \n \n \n \nKadapathaka Chaya\n \n \n \n \n \nBadulu Kochchiya\n \n \n \n \n \nNommara 17\n \nVijaya\n \n \n \n \nVaradata Danduvam\n \n \nAlso film's producer\n \n \n \nRandenigala Sinhaya\n \n \n \n \n \n1990\n \nDese Mal Pipila\n \n \nVijey\n \n \n \n \n \nThanha Asha\n \n \n \n \n \nVeera Udara\n \n \nGuest Appearance\n \n \n \nChristhu Charithaya\n \nJesus\n \n \n \n \nSaharawe Sihinaya\n \n \nSarasaviya Awards for \nBest Playback Singer'\n \n \n \n1991\n \nMadhusamaya\n \n \n \n \n \n1993\n \nSoorayan Athara Veeraya\n \n \n \n \n \n1995\n \nHitha Honda Soorayo\n \n \n \n \n \n1998\n \nAya Obata Barai\n \n \n \n \n "}, {"name": "Mariazelle Goonetilleke", "info": "Sri Lankan musician", "Intro": "Sri Lankan musician", "Is": "Singer", "From": "Sri Lanka", "Type": "Music", "Gender": "female", "description": "Mariazelle Goonetilleke is a leading Sri Lankan singer and music star. She has performed to capacity filled auditoriums not only in Sri Lanka but also as far afield as the United Kingdom, United States, United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Australia.Early years\n \nMariazelle Goonetilleke was born in Nugegoda in Colombo, Sri Lanka. She began her music career at the age of 7 years. At the age of 10 Mariazelle won the Junior Section of the Ceylon Observer All Island Talent Competition \u2013 it opened the door for her to join a pre-teen group of young musicians called the 'Junior Rhythmiers', a music group that was popular in Sri Lanka. The group were thrown into the spotlight when they were featured in the 1960s over the airwaves of Radio Ceylon, the oldest radio station in South Asia. The radio station 'ruled the airwaves' in the 1950s and 1960s so any exposure on Radio Ceylon was a huge boost to young artistes on the island. Mariazelle's music career spiralled upwards.\n \nShe studied classical guitar tutored by the renowned classical guitarist, the late Winston Jayawardene and vocal music from Mrs. Estelle de Niese. Mariazelle Goonetilleke attended St. Joseph's Convent School, Nugegoda.\n Kandy Lamissi\n \nWinning the Ceylon Observer Talent Contest was a huge boost for Mariazelle. According to the Sunday Observer of Colombo: ' This gave her more courage to play with bands like \"The Emeralds\" and the \"Midnight Mist\". Recording \"Kandy Lamissi\" in 1977 was the virtual turning point in her career. The song was an instant hit and Mariazelle came to be known by that name.\n \nThis new \"Kandy Lamissi\" had to move from place to place not only here, but also in top hotels like Soaltee Oberoi in Kathmandu, Nepal to perform. In the same year she met with an accident in Nuwara Eliya in which she sustained serious injuries to her spine and collar bone. Helped by her dear classmate, Christine Nadarajah at that time, her belief in God and community prayers saw her out from that dark period, Mariazelle claimed. Out from hospital Mariazelle had the privilege of getting the helping hands of legends like Clarence Wijewardene, the Emperor of Baila, M. S. Fernando, Stanley Peiris, Ajantha Ranasinghe, Chandral Fonseka and Sunil/Piyal of the \"Gypsies\". The compositions of Clarence and others provided her a different style and rendition that attracted music lovers. Ajantha's composition \"Sihina Nelum Mal\" was dedicated to her son, Teshan now studying in England.'\n Music Genre\n \nMariazelle has been involved with a range of music genre \u2013 from western pop music to Sri Lankan baila. She is now well known as a leading baila singer, performing her massive hit 'Kandy Lamissi,' all over the world. American Fulbright Scholar, Vasana Kelum de Mel, from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) observed: 'Since I feel it is an essential issue to study the 'gender Baila' as well, the work of the female Baila singers like Mariazelle Goonetilleke and Corinne Almeida should also be appreciated,' she said.\n \nShe has also collaborated with some of Sri Lanka's top musicians, among them Sunil Perera of the Gypsies, M.S. Fernando, Dalreen Suby, Clarence Wijewardena, Annesley Malewana, Damian Wickramatilleke, Maxi Rozairo, Shanelle Fernando, Umara Sinhawansa, Ashanthi De Alwis and Raj Seneviratne.\n \nSri Lanka's superstar spoke about her own struggles and her rise to fame in 2003 in an interview with the Sunday Observer, Sri Lanka: 'To have remained as I am in the music scene for 35 years, retaining and who and what I am is a most difficult thing. It's a feeling of elation because of the struggles I have faced to come out on top.'\n \nThe Island newspaper in Colombo noted that, 'Kandy Lamissi hitmaker Mariazelle Goonetilleke, is another local artiste who is very much in demand with Sri Lankans, domiciled abroad.She is regularly seen in Melbourne, London, the Middle East, Canada and most foreign cities where Sri Lankan Associations exist. Her popularity abroad could be attributed to her versatility, she could handle most songs with ease \u2013 be it Sinhala, English, Hindi or Tamil.Mariazelle also has the ability to communicate with her audience in a friendly manner. And most people like her style.'\n Christian Faith\n \nMariazelle became a committed Christian in 2009. According to the Island newspaper:'Mariazelle is very much into religion and has taken God as her friend and saviour.' She joined the People's Church in Colombo. Mariazelle said: 'I have sung all my life but now there is singing in my heart. The greatest song I sing is with God as my audience.'\n \nIn 2010, Mariazelle Goonetilleke celebrated 42 years, in the world of entertainment, in South Asia.\n "}, {"name": "Sunil Santha", "info": "Sri Lankan musician", "Intro": "Sri Lankan musician", "Was": "Singer", "From": "Sri Lanka", "Type": "Music", "Gender": "male", "Birth": "14 April 1915", "Death": "11 April 1981\n(aged 66 years)", "description": "Sunil Santha (Sinhala:\u0dc3\u0dd4\u0db1\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dca \u0dc3\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dca\u0dad; 14 April 1915 \u2013 11 April 1981) was a renowned and influential Sri Lankan composer, singer and lyricist. He was pivotal in the development of Sinhala music and folk songs in the mid to late 1940s and early 1950s. He composed the beloved soundtracks to Lester James Peries' Rekava and Sandesaya in 1956 and 1960. In a later comeback, he produced several experimental works. \nLife and career\n \nEarly life (1915\u20131945)\n \nSunil Santha was born on 14 April 1915 on the Sinhalese New Year's Day in Dehiyagatha, Jaela. Both his parents died before he was two years old, and Santha was raised by his grandmother. At an early age he came to the limelight when he played king Dutugamunu in a village play. One villager adorned him with a battery-powered lighted necklace. He had his education at prestigious St. Aloysius College, Galle .\n \nSantha passed the school leaving certificate examination as the first in the island, with the highest marks in his class as a young adult and was awarded the Weeraratne award. In 1933 he completed the Teachers Final Examination and began work as a teacher at the Mt. Calvary School. While tenured there, Santha led the school to three consecutive victories at the Southern Schools Music Competition. In 1939 he passed the Intermediate Gandarva Examination and received a certificate in physical training. He also learned to play the piano and guitar at that time. He acted and produced several dramas including \"Hamlet\" during this period.\n \nIn 1940 Santha gave up teaching and travelled to Shantiniketan to study music. The following year Santha enrolled at the Bhatkhande Music Institute and worked to get his Visharadha Degree in 1944. He passed the final exam as the first in the first division in Sitar and Vocals, the first non-Indian Asian to do so. He then adopted the name \"Sunil Santha\". During his studies in India he regularly contributed to Sri Lankan newspapers.\n \nRadio Ceylon (1946\u20131952)\n \nOn 2 March 1946 Santha held a recital for the Kumaratunga Commemoration ceremony and was asked to record for Radio Ceylon. Over the next six years, he would have a string of popular songs including \"Olu Pipila\" (the first song to be recorded at then Radion Ceylon), \"Handapane\", \"Ho Ga Rella Negay\", \"Bowitiya Dan Palukan Vare\", \"Suwada Rosa Mal Nela\", \"Kokilayange\", and \"Mihikathanalawala.\" Santha stressed his Sinhala heritage in his songs opting to sing in Sinhala rather than English and not copy Hindustani and Tamil songs of India. A diligent songwriter himself, Santha sang songs written by lyricists like Huberth Dissanayake, Munidasa Cumaratunga, Raipiel Tennakoon, Arisen Ahubudu and Fr. Marcelline Jayakody.\n \nIn 1952 Santha was banned from Radio Ceylon after refusing to audition for Indian musician Ratanjankar, whom the corporation had brought from South India to oversee the direction of music on their stations. That year he married school teacher Bernadet Leelawathi Jayasekara.\n \nLater life\n \nSantha experienced monetary problems after being terminated from Radio Ceylon. His songbooks were plagiarised, his songs were sold without consent or royalties by copyright violators. He tried his hand at various trades like photography, selling clothes and electronics over the next few years.\n \nIn 1953 Santha started a small school at the Maradana Newton building, vowing to teach 10 pupils for free. He often helped fellow artists and promising talent. He wrote to newspapers about the plight of Ananda Samarakoon and tried to bring attention to the composer of the national anthem. At a time when Albert Perera (later known as W.D. Amaradeva) who used to play violin at Sunil's performances, was in need of help, Sunil gave him two of his music classes at Panadura to teach and make a living. Sunil also helped collect money to send Amaradewa for further studies in India.\n \nIn 1955 journalist DB Dhanapala started a campaign to expose Santha's plight and raised some money through his column on \nLankadeepa\n.\n \nIn 1967 Director General Mr. Neville Jayaweera asked Santha to come back to the national radio service. Santha worked with W.D. Amaradeva and H.W. Rupasinghe to audition the artists.\n \nSantha moved into his uncle's house in 1970 as he was evicted from the rental house he lived in.\n \nIn 1977 a record titled \nSunil Gee\n was produced. n 1980 a record titled \nSeegiril Gee\n was produced. This contained a set of songs written and composed by Sunil with melodies using only four notes. The lyrics were based on Sigiri Kurutu Gee (sigiri graffiti). The songs are remarkable in that they used traditional Sri Lankan drums and other instruments to create a unique sound.\n \nSantha died on 11 April 1981 from a heart attack shortly after his son Jagath drowned under mysterious circumstances in a swimming pool.\n "}, {"name": "Mohideen Baig", "info": "Sri Lankan singer", "Intro": "Sri Lankan singer", "Was": "Singer", "From": "Sri Lanka", "Type": "Music", "Gender": "male", "Birth": "5 December 1919", "Death": "4 November 1991\n(aged 71 years)", "Star sign": "Sagittarius", "Instruments:": "Voice", "description": "\nMohideen Baig\n (1919\u20131991) was a notable Sri Lankan musician known particularly for his Buddhist devotional music, which enjoy popularity to this day.

In 1966, they formed a group called the Moonstones. Annesley Malawana is an influential Sri Lankan musician.\nLife and careerMalewana was born in Ratnapura (a city in south-central Sri Lanka) and attended St. Joseph\u2019s College in the capital city of Colombo. Upon leaving school, he met \nClarence Wijewardena\n, and the two formed the group Moonstones. In the early 1960s, the Moonstones began performing songs composed by Wijewardena and sung by Malewana (their first hit was \nMango Nanda\n - a song written about the maid who once worked at the home of Clarence's wife in the early days of their relationship).\nMoonstonesPrimarily due to Wijewardena's unique compositions, the Moonstones continued to dominate popular Sri Lankan music for nearly a decade before ultimately breaking up in the late 1960s. The Moonstones were managed by the advertising man Sri Sangabo Corea and were mentored by the legendary Radio Ceylon broadcaster \nVernon Corea\n and his cousin \nVijaya Corea\n. Their music was featured for the very first time on the English Services of Radio Ceylon and subsequently the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. They became household names as a result of the airplay on Radio Ceylon throughout the 1960s. Annesley Malewana was well known for being a master of contemporary baila.\nDuring the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, the songs of the 'Moonstones' and the 'Super Golden Chimes' were on the lips of so many music lovers in Sri Lanka - the musicians were at their peak and Annesley had reached the heights of popularity in the world of music on the island.\nSuper Golden ChimesMalewana and Wijewardena remained friends and reunited in the 1970s to form a group dubbed the \nSuper Golden Chimes\n - this group would, similarly, produce a string of popular songs that included \nUdarata Niliya\n (\nUp-Country Dancer\n), \nSihina Pathum\n (\nIn Dreams\n), \nWana Bambaro\n (\nJungle/Wild Bee\n), and \nSathuta Senasuma\n (\nHappy Feelings\n).\nThe Super Golden Chimes performed for another eight years until, in 1978, Malewana married, and announced his retirement from music. Despite his retirement, Malewana returned in 1988 as a solo artist, and continued to record songs particularly for CDs released in Sri Lanka.\nSuper ChimesMalewana came out of retirement to get back into the music world. In 2005 he formed the band \nAnnesley & The Super Chimes\n.\nAccording to Malewana: \"It was a long felt need in the music scene especially after the Super Golden Chimes Reunion Concert which was held last year. I was under tremendous pressure from my fans and well-wishers to continue with the Super Golden Chimes, but since some of the members are abroad and some others are playing in different groups, I did not want to use the name Super Golden Chimes.\"\nThe songs performed by Malewana and Clarence over their three decade careers have recently been credited, by the group Pahan Silu, as having served to influence them in crafting their unique musical style. Annesley Malewana has reached the pinnacle of fame as a highly respected recording artiste and as an accomplished musician. Together with his close friend, the late Clarence Wijewardena, they were at the very top of music world in South Asia. Wijeywardena and Malewana were two of the most sought after musicians in Sri Lanka.\nTheir songs topped the charts on both the English Service and the Sinhala Service on Radio Ceylon/Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation for decades. Annesley Malewana has also made countless appearances on television.\nHis voice has been heard by Londoners over BBC Radio London 206 on the 'London Sounds Eastern' radio programme and on community radio in the United States and in Australia.\nListen to Annesley Malewana on YouTube:\n"}, {"name": "Tharaka Mahesh", "info": "Sri Lankan designer", "Intro": "Sri Lankan designer", "Known for": "Artist of the Albums: zuoiouz, Forneybybeek, Fire Nations, Sensa 2020, Neegalle", "A.K.A.": "Wekwella Gamage Tharaka Mahesh Piyarathna, Tharaka Mahesh Piyarathna, ...", "Is": "Designer\nArtist\nAuthor\nMusician\nSinger\nActor\nYouTuber\nLyricist", "From": "Sri Lanka", "Gender": "male", "Birth": "20 February 1997, Nawagamuwa", "Age": "24 years", "Residence": "Kaduwela", "Family": "Mother:\n\nThilaka Jayangani\n\n\n\nFather:\n\nPiyarathna", "Stats": "Height:\n\n175 cm", "Education": "Dharmapala Vidyalaya Pannipitiya\nG6-A/L\n2008-2016\n\n\nPrimary School Bomiriya\nG1-5\n2003-2007", "Notable Works": "zuoiouz\n2020\n\n\nForneybybeek\n2020\n\n\nFire Nations\n2020\n\n\nSensa 2020\n2020\n\n\nNeegalle\n2020\n\n\nHow to Get a Sri Lankan Driver's License\n2021", "Profiles": "", "description": "Tharaka Mahesh\n is a freelancer graphic designer in Sri Lanka, with experience of designing and advertising music.Tharaka Mahesh\n was born on 20th February 1997 at Nawagamuwa, Sri Lanka.Wekwella Gamage \nTharaka Mahesh\n Piyarathna commonly \nTharaka Mahesh\n, (Sinhala: \u0dad\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0d9a \u0db8\u0dc4\u0dda\u0dc2\u0dca, Tamil: \u0ba4\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0b95 \u0bae\u0b95\u0bc7\u0bb7\u0bcd) is a Sri Lankan author, designer, artist, creator, philanthropist, social media personality and internet entrepreneur.
